# Search Movie Synopsis

As a student, I wanted to do something simple with any API. I also wanted it to be legal, so I used the YTS API in a node project to fetch movie details. It is just for fun.

API does not require any key.

Run

	npm install

It has only one dependency.

After installing you can you can use 2 keywords and they it works is, you can say

**search** _for_ **name of the movie**

	node movie.js search for lord of the rings

or
**genre** _of_ **type of genre**

	node movie.js genre of comedy
